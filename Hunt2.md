# Threat Event (Simulated Lateral Movement via PsExec)
**Process-Based Lateral Movement and File Drop Simulation Using PsExec**

## Steps the "Bad Actor" Took to Create Logs and IoCs:
1. Downloaded and executed `PsExec.exe` from the Sysinternals suite.

2. Ran the following command to simulate lateral movement:  
   `PsExec.exe \\localhost cmd.exe`

3. From the PsExec-launched `cmd.exe` shell, launched `powershell.exe`.

4. Inside the PowerShell session, executed a file creation command:  
   `Set-Content -Path "C:\Users\Public\psexec_logged.txt" -Value "test"`

5. The file was successfully written to disk, but Defender for Endpoint did **not log** the file creation.

## Tables Used to Detect IoCs:

| Parameter | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | `DeviceProcessEvents` |
| **Info** | [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-deviceprocessevents-table](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-deviceprocessevents-table) |
| **Purpose** | Used to detect the execution of `PsExec.exe`, the deployment of `psexesvc.exe`, and subsequent process activity such as `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` launched via PsExec. |

| Parameter | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | `DeviceFileEvents` |
| **Info** | [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-devicefileevents-table](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-devicefileevents-table) |
| **Purpose** | Used to detect any files created as a result of remote shell activity. In this case, a `.txt` file was created via PowerShell but was not logged â€” highlighting a visibility gap in benign file creation events. |
