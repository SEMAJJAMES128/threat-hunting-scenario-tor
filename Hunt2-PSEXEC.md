# Threat Hunt Report: Unauthorized Remote Execution via PsExec
- [Scenario Creation](https://github.com/SEMAJJAMES128/threat-hunting-scenario-tor/blob/main/Hunt2.md)

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- PsExec (Sysinternals Suite)

##  Scenario

Security noticed an unusual command-line pattern on a lab system suggesting remote code execution activity. Suspicion grew after audit logs revealed system-level process spawns without standard user interaction. Management requested a threat hunt to determine whether tools like PsExec were being used to establish unauthorized remote shells, spawn PowerShell sessions, or create untracked files.
The goal of this hunt is to validate the presence of lateral movement techniques using PsExec, confirm chained execution activity, and assess visibility into file creation from remote shells.


### High-Level PsExec-Related IoC Discovery Plan

- **Check `DeviceProcessEvents`** for execution of `PsExec.exe` and `psexesvc.exe`.
- **Trace process lineage from `psexesvc.exe` â†’ `cmd.exe` â†’ `powershell.exe`.**
- **Use `DeviceFileEvents` to determine whether files were created via the PsExec-launched session.**

---

## Steps Taken

### 1. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table for PsExec Execution

Queried for known PsExec binaries (`PsExec.exe`, `psexesvc.exe`) to confirm execution. These are strong indicators of lateral movement or post-exploitation.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "sjpay2"
| where FileName in~ ("PsExec.exe", "psexesvc.exe")
| project FileName, ProcessCommandLine, DeviceName, DeviceId

```

---

### 2. Investigated What Was Spawned by PsExec

Queried for any child processes launched by psexesvc.exe. cmd.exe was confirmed as the next link in the process chain, indicating interactive shell access via PsExec.

**Query used to locate event:**

```kql

DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "sjpay2"
| where InitiatingProcessFileName == "psexesvc.exe"
| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, AccountName, InitiatingProcessFileName


```

---

### 3. Traced Follow-up Execution from CMD to PowerShell

Confirmed that powershell.exe was launched via the cmd.exe session initiated by PsExec, continuing the attackerâ€™s activity chain.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "sjpay2"
| where InitiatingProcessFileName == "cmd.exe"
| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, AccountName, InitiatingProcessFileName

```

---

### 4. Searched for File Creation Activity in Public Folder

Queried DeviceFileEvents to determine if PowerShell dropped any files in the C:\Users\Public\ directory. A .txt file was manually confirmed on disk, but not logged in Defender, exposing a telemetry gap.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "sjpay2"
| where FolderPath has "Public"
| project Timestamp, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine;

```

## Chronological Event Timeline 

ðŸŸ© Step 1: 

PsExec.exe was executed on host sjpay2 to simulate lateral movement using the command:
{PsExec.exe \\localhost cmd.exe}
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logged the execution of PsExec.exe and its service psexesvc.exe.

ðŸŸ© Step 2: 

psexesvc.exe launched a new instance of cmd.exe on the same device (sjpay2).
This shell ran with elevated privileges, simulating post-exploitation access.

ðŸŸ© Step 3: 

Within the remote shell session, cmd.exe launched powershell.exe, continuing the chain of execution.
PowerShell was used to run attacker-simulated commands.

ðŸŸ¨ Step 4: 

Inside the PowerShell session, the following command was executed:
{Set-Content -Path "C:\Users\Public\psexec_logged.txt" -Value "test"}
The file was confirmed to exist on disk in C:\Users\Public, indicating successful file creation from the attackerâ€™s perspective.

ðŸŸ¥ Step 5:

Querying DeviceFileEvents for the expected .txt file yielded no results.
This highlights a potential telemetry gap where non-malicious file creations through remote shells may go unlogged unless flagged or audited explicitly.

## Summary

On May 25, 2025, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint telemetry revealed that a system-level process (psexesvc.exe) had launched an unexpected cmd.exe shell on endpoint sjpay2. Further investigation showed that PsExec.exe was used by the user labuser to remotely execute commands on the machine.

The process chain indicated potential unauthorized lateral movement activity. This was followed by the execution of PowerShell and an attempted file write operation to a shared public directory (C:\Users\Public\). While the file (psexec_logged.txt) was manually verified on disk, no telemetry was generated by DeviceFileEvents, highlighting a visibility gap in endpoint logging.

This behavior â€” remote shell via PsExec, privilege-level PowerShell use, and unlogged file drops â€” is consistent with known post-exploitation techniques used by threat actors following credential compromise.

## Response Taken

The device sjpay2 was immediately isolated from the network to contain potential lateral movement. A forensic image of the endpoint was captured for further investigation. The account labuser was disabled pending review of all interactive logon activity across other endpoints.

Additionally, a detection rule was proposed to alert on the execution of PsExec.exe and child processes like cmd.exe or powershell.exe launched by psexesvc.exe. The security team recommended enabling advanced file system auditing and reviewing EDR logging coverage to address gaps where low-signal actions like public file creation go unrecorded.

A formal incident report was opened and escalated to the threat response team for further analysis and review of lateral movement patterns in the environment.
